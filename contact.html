  Our glitter material undergoes a special double-dip process that adds 200% more sparkle resin than typical glitter acryclic. This is the highest grade and quality available today, which means higher vibrancy and lower translucency for your piece. Don't be fooled by cheap substitutes which have less glitter per inch -- enabling you to see through the acrylic. Also, beware companies who claim to have glitter but use cheaper stick-on glitter paper.
